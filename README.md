  <h2> PROBLEM STATEMENT: GAMEFIELD CODING FOR KIDS </h2>
    <h2>MEMORY PUZZLE GAMEðŸŽ®ðŸ§©</h2>
  A memory puzzle game typically presents a grid of cards, each hiding an image or symbol. Players flip two cards at a time, aiming to find matching pairs. The game continues until all pairs are matched. Developing this game involves several key components:

1. User Interface (UI): Designing a visually appealing and intuitive layout using HTML and CSS.

2. Game Logic: Implementing functionality with JavaScript to handle card flipping, matching logic, and tracking the player's progress.

3. Randomization: Shuffling cards to ensure a unique arrangement for each game session.

Interactivity: Adding event listeners to respond to user actions, such as clicking on cards.
